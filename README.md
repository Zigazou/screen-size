Screen-Size
===========

Screen-Size gives you screen dimensions according to ratio, diagonal, width or
height.

It is an experimentation of the Haste language (Haskell transpiled to
JavaScript) and Grid CSS.

It can be run locally in a web browser (just look at screen-size.html in the
`dist` directory).
